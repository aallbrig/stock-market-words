# Stock Market Words: A Website
Why? Why not. I remembered reading about how linux has a file with a dictionary in it.

I amuse myself imagining this list providing some sort of trading edge for any type of investor.

### [QA Environment](https://aallbrig.github.io/stock-market-words/)
![QR code for QA environment](./static/media/qa-env-qr-code.png)

## Developer Section

### Getting Started
Bash scripts
```bash
# Start up a local static HTTP server (requires python3)
./scripts/website-up.sh
./scripts/website-down.sh
# Test local static HTTP server (requires node)
./scripts/website-test.sh

# Single liner
./scripts/website-down.sh && ./scripts/website-up.sh

# Extract stock exchange(s) data
./scripts/extract-exchanges-txt-data.sh

# Create resources on AWS (idempotent shell script)
./scripts/infrastructure-up.sh
```

Python scripts
```bash
# Virtual environment
python3 -m virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
source venv/bin/deactivate

# Install requirements
pip3 install -r src/requirements.txt

# Test python files
python3 -m unittest -v

# Run python script
python3 -m src.app
```
### Developer quick commands
```bash
# Preferred Development Bash Command
./scripts/infrastructure-down.sh && ./scripts/infrastructure-down.sh && ./scripts/infrastructure-up.sh && ./scripts/infrastructure-up.sh
# Note: the double call is to ensure the script is idempotent in a user friendly way
```
