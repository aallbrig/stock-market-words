## What is this strategy?

**For contrarian investors who "catch falling knives" - buying beaten-down stocks with potential for rebound.**

This strategy finds oversold stocks (low RSI) trading BELOW their 200-day moving average. The classic contrarian play: when others are fearful and selling, you're buying the dip, betting on mean reversion.

## Filter Criteria

```
rsi < 30 AND price < ma200
```

**In plain English:** We're looking for stocks that:
- Are deeply oversold (RSI < 30 = recent heavy selling pressure)
- Are trading BELOW their 200-day average price (technical support level)
- Have fallen significantly, creating potential bounce-back opportunity

**Strategy Score:** Lower RSI and bigger gap below MA-200 earn higher scores. More oversold stocks trading further below their average score better.

**⚠️ Warning:** They call it "catching a falling knife" for a reason - some stocks fall for good reasons. Do your research before buying.

This page shows all stocks that currently match this strategy's criteria. The data is updated daily based on the latest market data from Yahoo Finance.
