## What is this strategy?

**For income-focused investors seeking steady, reliable returns with lower risk.**

This strategy identifies stocks that pay attractive dividends while maintaining relatively stable prices (low beta/volatility). Think established companies with consistent cash flow that reward shareholders through regular dividend payments.

## Filter Criteria

```
dividend_yield > 0 AND has_ma200_data
```

**In plain English:** We're looking for stocks that:
- Pay dividends (any positive yield)
- Have at least 200 days of trading history
- Are trading at reasonable prices and volumes (our base filters)

**Strategy Score:** Higher dividend yields and lower beta (volatility) earn higher scores. A stock with 5% yield and beta of 0.8 scores better than one with 2% yield and beta of 1.5.

This page shows all stocks that currently match this strategy's criteria. The data is updated daily based on the latest market data from Yahoo Finance.
