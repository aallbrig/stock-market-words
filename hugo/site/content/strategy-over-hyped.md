## What is this strategy?

**For short sellers and traders expecting mean reversion - identifying overextended stocks due for a pullback.**

This strategy finds overbought stocks (high RSI) that have run up too far, too fast. When RSI exceeds 70, it suggests buying exhaustion and potential reversal. Great for short positions or waiting to buy after a dip.

## Filter Criteria

```
rsi > 70
```

**In plain English:** We're looking for stocks that:
- Are overbought (RSI > 70 = recent heavy buying, potentially overdone)
- Have strong recent momentum that may be unsustainable
- Could see profit-taking or pullback as momentum fades

**Strategy Score:** Higher RSI earns higher scores. More overbought = riper for reversal.

**Use Cases:**
- **Short selling:** Enter short positions expecting pullback
- **Buy-the-dip waiting:** Add to watchlist, wait for RSI to cool off
- **Profit taking:** If you own these, consider taking some gains
