## What is this strategy?

**For aggressive investors seeking explosive growth potential and willing to accept high volatility.**

This strategy targets stocks with high beta (volatile, reactive to market swings) that are currently showing momentum. Think growth stocks with high volatility - "catch them before they rocket."

## Filter Criteria

```
beta > 1.5 AND rsi < 70
```

**In plain English:** We're looking for stocks that:
- Move MORE than the market (beta > 1.5 means 50%+ more volatile)
- Have room to run (RSI < 70 means not yet overbought)
- Have strong momentum potential for rapid gains

**Strategy Score:** Higher beta combined with lower RSI earns better scores. More volatile stocks with more room to grow score higher.

This page shows all stocks that currently match this strategy's criteria. The data is updated daily based on the latest market data from Yahoo Finance.

2. Sort by **Beta** to find most volatile (highest growth potential)
3. Sort by **RSI (14-Day)** to find best entry points
4. Check **Strategy Score** (higher = best combo of volatility + momentum)
5. ⚠️ **High risk, high reward** - consider position sizing carefully
